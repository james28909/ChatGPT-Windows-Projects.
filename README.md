imotb - is a scrip tthat adds the function to change system volume level when scrolling the taskbar area
ctxmenu - is a script that enables you the ability to scroll windows explorer context menus, why this fnctionality hasnt been supported by ms officialls is crazy. my right click menu is a pretty good size and it sucked having to click that little fuckin arrows! fix this shit MS
test - is a script that was just a test to see if i could get ChatGPT to do this stuff, and it did!

i think imotb is an actual gui application that hides its window (isnt used anyway) which allows you to add it to startup programs directory. it also has a icon in systray that allows you to exit if right clicked.

if anyone has any extra ideas that is missing in windows, lets compile a good list here!
